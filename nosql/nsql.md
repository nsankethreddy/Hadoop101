# NOSQL
Not Only SQL  

Where Relational Database(RDBMS) cannot make the cut.


### What is the right tool for the job?
- For analytic queries RDBMS like Hive, Pig, Spark work great.
- Exporting data to MySQL is plenty fast for most applications too
- But if you wort at a gaint scale, export your data to a non relational DB for fast and scalable serving of that data to a web application, etc.

Some examples for NOSQL
- HBASE 
- Cassandra
- MongoDB
